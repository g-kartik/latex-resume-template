# LaTeX Resume Template

When it comes to making our resume, we always turn towards some word processor like MS Word and borrow some templates available online.
The problem is that they are not flexible and precise in terms of editing. Since they are WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, therefore both content and style are edited on the same page. This makes it hard to customise the styling as we have to deal with the content too.  
With LaTeX we can edit content and styling separately and we can version control it.  
The design is inspired by two LaTeX templates.

## Comparing LaTeX to WYSIWYG editors:

1. **Professional Typography:**
   - *LaTeX:* Utilizes high-quality typography algorithms, resulting in a polished and professional-looking document.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* May not always provide the same level of typographic precision, leading to potential formatting inconsistencies.

2. **Separation of Content and Style:**
   - *LaTeX:* Promotes a clear separation between content and formatting. This allows you to focus on the content without being distracted by the visual appearance.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* Often mix content and formatting, making it harder to maintain consistency and revise the document.

3. **Version Control Integration:**
   - *LaTeX:* Facilitates easy integration with version control systems like Git, enabling efficient tracking of changes and collaborative editing.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* May not be as seamlessly integrated with version control tools, making collaboration and version tracking more challenging.

4. **Customization and Templates:**
   - *LaTeX:* Offers extensive customization options and a wide range of templates designed for resumes, allowing for a personalized and unique document.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* While templates are available, they may not provide the same level of flexibility and customization as LaTeX.

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency:**
   - *LaTeX:* Generates consistent output across different platforms and devices, ensuring that the resume appears as intended regardless of the viewer's system.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* Documents may sometimes look different on various platforms due to variations in rendering.

6. **Open Source and Platform Independence:**
   - *LaTeX:* Open-source and available on multiple platforms, ensuring that the document creation process is not tied to a specific operating system.
   - *WYSIWYG Editors:* Some editors may be platform-dependent, potentially limiting accessibility and collaboration.
